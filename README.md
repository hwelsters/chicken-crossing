## 🤔 FAQ
#### Is the game free?
Yes, and it always will be.
  
#### What game engine did you use?
I used Unity and C# to program the game and Aseprite for the art.

#### Help, what does the yellow block do?
It's supposed to be a honey block and honey blocks make things stick together. So if you move a honey block, every other block around it moves.
